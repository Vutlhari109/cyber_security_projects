# Scenario 2: Malware Beaconing Over HTTP

## Description
A client at `10.10.10.5` connects to a suspicious IP `45.33.32.156` on port 8080, commonly used by malware for command and control (C2) communication.

## Key Observations
- Normal TCP three-way handshake.
- The client sends an HTTP GET request to `/update/check`, typical for malware beaconing to check for updates or instructions.
- Server responds with HTTP 200 OK.
- Use of an uncommon port and unknown IP suggests malicious activity.

## Conclusion
Pattern matches malware C2 beaconing behavior. The destination IP and traffic should be further investigated.
