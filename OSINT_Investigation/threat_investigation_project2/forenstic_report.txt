🧾 Report Template: Cybercrime OSINT and Network Investigation
📄 Title: Investigation Report on Suspected Malicious Domains Linked to IP Address 77.37.34.191

IP ADDRESS SOURCE: Published by VIRUS TOTAL

🕵️‍♂️ Investigator:
Name: Vutlhari Mathebula

Role: Independent Cyber Threat Analyst

Tools Used: VirusTotal, Spider-foot, ViewDNS, WHOIS, Nmap, HTTP Headers, Browser Agent, OSINT tools

🗓️ Date: 04 August 2025

🧠 Objective:
To analyze a reported suspicious IP address and uncover any connected malicious infrastructure such as domains, server behavior, or brute force patterns.

🌐 Initial Indicator (IOC):
IP Address: 77.37.34.191


Flagged on: VirusTotal link - https://www.virustotal.com/gui/ip-address/77.37.34.191 

Associated with 50+ domains as seen on [viewdns.info]

🔍 OSINT & Network Findings:
1. Linked Domains
Total Domains Found: 53

Domain Patterns: Suspicious TLDs, keyword stuffing, expired SSL

Example Domains:

suspicious-domain1.com

payment-gateway-free-checker.site

login-facebook-secure-reset.shop

2. WHOIS / Registrar Info
Most domains anonymized or registered under privacy-protected services

Recent bulk registrations (suggesting automation)

3. Server Behavior (Nmap/Web Headers)
Open Ports: 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 22 (SSH), 3306 (MySQL)

XML-RPC endpoint responding with POST-only (WordPress indicator)

HTTP Headers reveal:

Outdated Server Software

Suspicious redirections

PHP warning errors

4. Potential Brute Force / Exploit Activity
XML-RPC (/xmlrpc.php) active on WordPress sites — known brute force vector

No rate limiting detected

Weak login responses and no CAPTCHA — could enable forceful entry

Some pages showing signs of auto-login redirection tricks

🔥 Risk Assessment:
Risk Type	Evidence	Severity
Command & Control (C2)	Multiple domains linked to single IP	High
Brute Force Possible	Weak auth points like XML-RPC exposed	Medium
Phishing Pages	Suspicious subdomain structure + redirects	High
OSINT Traceability	Privacy-guarded WHOIS, hard to attribute owner	Medium

🛑 Conclusion:
This IP and its related domains present strong indicators of being part of a malicious or criminal infrastructure, possibly linked to phishing, brute-force attacks, or botnet C2 hosting. The investigation was done ethically using public tools and without unauthorized access.

📨 Recommended Actions:
Report this IP and related domains to:
