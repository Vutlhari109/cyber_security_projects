# Digital Forensics Portfolio

## Overview
This repository showcases a comprehensive **Digital Forensics Portfolio** demonstrating practical investigations across multiple domains: disk analysis, memory forensics, network forensics, malware analysis, log analysis, OSINT investigations, mobile forensics, file carving, forensic correlation, and incident response simulations.  

Each project simulates real-world forensic scenarios where evidence is recovered, analyzed, and preserved in a professional chain-of-custody workflow.

## Project Domains

### 01. Disk Forensics
Investigate disk images, recover deleted files, and analyze filesystem metadata to uncover evidence.  
- **Deleted Files Recovery:** Recover deleted documents, images, and PDFs using Sleuth Kit and Photorec.  
- **NTFS Metadata Analysis:** Analyze NTFS timestamps, file system artifacts, and generate timeline reports.

### 02. Memory Forensics
Analyze RAM dumps to identify malware, suspicious processes, and runtime artifacts.  
- **Malware RAM Analysis:** Investigate memory dumps for malicious code using Volatility.  
- **Process Hunting:** Identify and document anomalous or suspicious processes.

### 09. Malware Forensic Correlation
Correlate evidence across logs, network, and memory to reconstruct incidents.  
- **Log + Network + Memory Correlation:** Combine artifacts to build a complete picture of an attack.  
[View Correlation Projects](Malware_Forensic_Correlation/)

### 10. Incident Response Simulation
Simulate full forensic investigations including reporting and timeline reconstruction.  
- **Full Investigation Report:** Document findings in professional PDF reports with evidence screenshots.  
- **Timeline Analysis:** Create comprehensive timelines of events from collected artifacts.
