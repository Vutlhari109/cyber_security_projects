# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Projects: Ethical Hacking & Forensics

A collection of hands-on cybersecurity tools, reverse shells, traffic logs, screenshots, and investigative reports for ethical hacking training and cybercrime forensics.

Built for learning and simulating real-world attack and defense techniques in safe environments.


---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Exploit intentionally vulnerable systems (e.g., DVWA, Juice Shop)
- Capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark
- Simulate real post-exploitation with reverse shell payloads
- Log attacker activity and generate penetration test reports
- Practice forensics by tracing attacks from victim systems
- Prepare a cybersecurity portfolio for career opportunities

---

## 🧰 Tools & Skills Used

- 🐍 Python (reverse shell, scanners, automation)
- 🐧 Kali Linux
- 📡 Netcat
- 🔍 Wireshark
- 🛡️ DVWA / OWASP Juice Shop
- 🧪 SQL Injection, Reverse Shells, Port Scanning
- 📑 Markdown & PDF Reporting
- 🔐 Ethical Hacking Principles
