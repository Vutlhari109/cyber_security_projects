ðŸ›¡Cyber Forensics & Disk Analysis ProjectsðŸ”Ž

## Project Overview
This repository showcases hands-on **cyber forensics investigations**, including disk image analysis, deleted file recovery, log correlation, and network event reconstruction. Projects simulate real-world forensic investigations where data has been deleted, altered, or compromised.

### Key Project: Deleted Files Recovery
- **Objective:** Recover deleted files from a disk image to simulate forensic evidence recovery.
- **Tools:** Sleuth Kit (`tsk_recover`, `fls`), Photorec, Autopsy (optional).
- **Methodology:**
  1. Mounted disk images using Sleuth Kit.
  2. Enumerated deleted files with `fls`.
  3. Recovered files using `tsk_recover`.
  4. Verified integrity and contents of recovered files.
- **Results:** Successfully recovered 100+ files (documents, images, PDFs) stored in `recovered_files/`. Screenshots and command outputs documented for evidence tracking.
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Disk image analysis, file system understanding (NTFS, FAT32), data recovery techniques, chain-of-custody documentation.

## Cyber Forensics & Threat Investigation Objectives
- Analyze and reconstruct events from compromised systems.
- Recover and preserve deleted or hidden data for evidence.
- Correlate system, application, and network logs to detect anomalies.
- Perform timeline analysis of attacker activity on victim systems.
- Conduct OSINT and threat intelligence investigations.
- Build a forensic portfolio suitable for cybersecurity careers in law enforcement, government, and corporate investigations.
