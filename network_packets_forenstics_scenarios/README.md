# Network Forensics Scenarios Collection

This repository contains multiple realistic network packet capture scenarios for learning and practicing network forensic analysis.

## Included Scenarios

1. **DNS Spoofing (Scenario 1)** - Detecting fake DNS responses inside a local network.  
2. **Malware Beaconing (Scenario 2)** - Malware communication with a C2 server over HTTP on a non-standard port.  
3. **DNS Spoofing with Local Response (Scenario 3)** - DNS replies from unexpected local IPs indicating poisoning.  
4. **ARP Spoofing / Man-in-the-Middle (Scenario 4)** - Multiple conflicting ARP replies indicating an ARP poisoning attack.  
5. **SSH Brute Force Login Attempts (Scenario 5)** - Repeated SSH login attempts with different usernames indicating brute forcing.

## How to Use

- Review the `.txt` files for raw network packet lines.  
- Read the corresponding `README.md` files for analysis, explanations, and key takeaways.  
- Use these scenarios for practice, training, or demonstration in interviews or portfolios.
